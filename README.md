# GBDK-Learning-Projects

## Various Programs

### Hello World
Use the GBDK to print out "Hello World" on a Game Boy
### SpriteStuff
Very simple program to animate and move a sprite around
### JoypadStuff
Simple program to register input on the joypad (TODO: play around with A, B, and Start/Select button) and have it move around a sprite on screen
### BackgroundStuff
Simple program to test out generating a scrolling background
### HeadsUpDisplay
Like BackgroundStuff, but incorporates a HUD (TODO: generate reference program to have the HUD be on top; apparently that's really hard to do)
### Sound
Basic program to generate a specific sound while a button on the joypad is pressed
### Noise
Fiddling around with the noise channel on the GB

## Usage
Feel free to use this as a resource, since I'm taking this from Gaming Monster's series on Game Boy development (with some of my notes included as time goes on). This is mainly for reference, and if you'd like to learn this, I'd suggest you actually do the programming as well.

Speaking of which, if any one of the creators of the content I used would like me to either change citation or remove said content, let me know and I will
