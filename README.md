## Various Programs

### Hello World
Use the GBDK to print out "Hello World" on a Game Boy
### SpriteStuff
Very simple program to animate and move a sprite around

## Usage
Feel free to use this as a resource, since I'm taking this from Gaming Monster's series on Game Boy development (with some of my notes included as time goes on). This is mainly for reference, and if you'd like to learn this, I'd suggest you actually do the programming as well.
